A little over a year ago I began speaking to a career coach to get assistance with finding a career path that’s a fit with my skills and passions. I had long been unfulfilled in my jobs, and had tried myself to research career options, but failed to find anything that truly felt right. 

Through my work with my career coach, I became interested in design, specifically graphic design. Many years ago, I had worked with small publishers to create book cover designs and marketing materials. I loved working in design, but my position did not pay well, and I soon had to move on to a more lucrative, less fun, career. 

My coach and I decided that it would be a good first step in transitioning my career for me to take some introductory courses in graphic design at a local college. One of the courses I took was Introduction to Digital Skills, where we learned the basics of Adobe Creative Cloud and HTML and CSS. I learned that I was not very talented, nor very interested, in creating artwork in Illustrator or Photoshop, but that I *did* like coding designs using HTML and CSS. I didn’t necessarily want to create designs, but I loved building them.

It was then that I had remembered that during my time in publishing, I was also heavily involved with the upkeep of author blogs, and worked often with Wordpress themes, editing CSS to create designs that better matched the branding of book collections. I had forgotten how enjoyable I found that work, and how satisfying it felt tinkering with code to alter the look of websites. 

After completing my digital skills class, I decided shift from graphic design courses to courses in coding. I started taking courses online with Skillcrush, in person with First Step Coding, and lastly through Flatiron’s free bootcamp prep program. After completing a few labs in the bootcamp prep program, I decided to take and jump and apply for the Online Web Developer Program. I was excited to be accepted into the program, and to also be awarded the Women Take Tech Scholarship. 

I’m in my first couple of weeks of the Online Web Developer Program and things are moving along! Although I had some introductory experience in coding before beginning the program, everything still feels very new to me. I’m learning what it takes to learn programming languages, how to reach out my my community for help, and how to make connections both on- and off-line with other programming students. I’m optimistic that I’ve found a career path that fits me, and can’t wait to see where it takes me!
